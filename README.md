# Proyecto

Proyecto is a project management app that is the perfect solution for any
corporate and technical company setup as it integrates all of the required
functionalities within a corporate setup into a single application.
We can create tasks, view project analytics, create different chat groups and
also use video-conferencing.





## Working of the App

We have two models for our app:

#### 1. Admin Model: 
This model is for the team leader or the manager of the
organization who will create projects. Within a project they can add
tasks to certain employees and it will be reflected on the employeeâ€™s
device in real time.
They can also review a certain task which has been completed by the
employee and mark them as completed.
Also admins can view various user analytics and project analysis, as to
track the current status of the project through the admin dashboard from
their profile.

#### 2. Employee Model: 
Employee Model: Employees will be able to view the projects and
tasks assigned to them by the admin.
Employees themselves can assign tasks between other employees but
do not have the ability to create a new project.
When clicked on a particular project, the various tasks will be displayed
to the employee with the deadline and priority.
When the task is completed, they can send it for review to the admin.
Employees, as well as admins, can create different chat groups for different
teams and departments.
They will also be able to conduct video conferences from within our app
